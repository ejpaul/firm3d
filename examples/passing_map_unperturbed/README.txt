This example computes the passing particle Poincare map in the Wistell-A configuration scaled 
to the size and field strength of ARIES-CS. Co-passing alpha particles (mu = 0, sign(v_{\|}) = +1) with 
the alpha particle birth energy are assumed. 

The example in the file passing_map_WBA.py performs the passing map, but with the chaos_detection parameter
enabled. Weighted Birkhoff Averaging is added as a setting to the passing map and applied to a particle canonical momentum 
to create a numerical metric (digit accuracy) of chaos, implemented as described in:

N. Duignan and J. D. Meiss. "Distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits of flows by the weighted birkhoff average." Physical Nonlinear Phenomena. (2023): 449:133749.

On perlmutter (06.17.25), the wallclock time is about 30 seconds using the attached slurm script. 
On macOS (06.17.25), the wallclock time is about 3.5 minutes, running with the command "mpiexec -n 8 python passing_map.py"
