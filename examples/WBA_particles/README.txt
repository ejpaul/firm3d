This example computes the Weighted Birkhoff average of the helical momentum 
in the beta = 2.5% QA configuration from Landreman & Buller.

Particles are instantiated uniformly in phase space, they are traced for 1x10^{-2} s. 
Weighted Birkhoff Averaging is added to create a numerical 
metric (Digit Accuracy) of chaos, implemented as described in:

N. Duignan and J. D. Meiss. "Distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits of flows by the weighted birkhoff average." Physical Nonlinear Phenomena. (2023): 449:133749.

The class can be used one of two ways: tracing the particles using trace_particles_boozer_perturbed or
trace_particles_boozer, and providing the trajectory output from this function, or by providing the initial
conditions for tracing, and the tracing occurring inside the WBAParticles class. The latter is
less memory intensive, as the full trajectories are never shared accross all communicators, unless
they are saved with the flag save_gc_trajectories. The second method of using the class is performed in
WBA_tracing_boozer.py. The same applies to the perturbed case, shown in WBA_tracing_perturbed.py.
